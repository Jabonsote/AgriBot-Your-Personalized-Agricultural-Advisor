# 🌾 Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making 🌍

![Presentation](image/presentation.gif)

This project provides a **free platform for farmers** to make data-driven decisions in agriculture using Earth Observation Data. By integrating **machine learning algorithms**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **chatbots**, the application offers predictions, insights, and reports based on environmental and climatic data.

---

## 📜 **Project Summary**

Agriculture is highly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. This platform leverages modern technologies to assist farmers by:

- Providing crop predictions based on climatic data.
- Generating detailed reports to support decision-making.
- Offering a chatbot to answer queries interactively.
- Ensuring all services are free and accessible.

## 🚀 **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: 
  - Algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Model: `recobo/agriculture-bert-uncased`
  - Libraries: `torch`, `joblib`, `scikit-learn`
- **Earth Observation & APIs**:
  - OpenMeteo API
  - OpenWeather API
- **Data Storage**: FAISS (for vector search)
- **Embedding Models**: HuggingFace Transformers
- **Frontend**: HTML templates for Flask
- **Other Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, LangChain

## 🛠️ **Implementation Overview**

### 1. **Data Retrieval**
   - PDFs containing agricultural data are processed with the `DirectoryLoader` and split into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
   - FAISS is used for storing embeddings generated by HuggingFace models.

### 2. **Machine Learning Model**
   - Pre-trained model `recobo/agriculture-bert-uncased` is fine-tuned for agricultural tasks.
   - The KNN model predicts suitable crops based on mean temperature and humidity values.

### 3. **Climatic Data**
   - APIs (OpenMeteo, OpenWeather) are used to fetch climate information, including:
     - Average temperature
     - Humidity levels
     - Historical and predicted trends

### 4. **Chatbot Functionality**
   - A chatbot powered by the LLM `llama3.2` provides interactive responses to user queries.
   - The `ConversationalRetrievalChain` integrates memory and retrieval capabilities for enhanced interaction.

### 5. **Web Interface**
   - A user-friendly web interface allows:
     - Querying city-specific climate data.
     - Interactive chat for decision-making.
     - Downloadable reports for farmers.

## 🌱 **Decision-Making Variables**

### **Key Inputs**:
- **Climatic Factors**: 
  - Mean temperature
  - Relative humidity
- **Geographical Location**: Latitude and longitude of the area.

### **Outputs**:
- Suitable crops based on climatic predictions.
- Recommendations for better yield.

## 📊 **Machine Learning Workflow**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Extract and scale temperature and humidity data.
2. **Training**:
   - Train a KNN model using historical crop yield data.
3. **Prediction**:
   - Use scaled climatic inputs to predict optimal crops.

---

## 💬 **Chatbot Features**

- Powered by **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to provide context-aware responses.
- Answers questions like:
  - "What crops are suitable for my area?"
  - "How can I improve crop yield based on the weather?"

---

## 📈 **Generating Reports**

- The application creates downloadable reports summarizing:
  - Historical climate data.
  - Crop predictions.
  - Recommendations for farm management.
